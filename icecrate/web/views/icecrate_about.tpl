  <h2>About Icecrate</h2>
  <p>Icecrate started during a discussion with the family about the state of our large bin freezer. Earlier that day, we had purchased a large quantity of groceries, and the freezer was packed full of food. It was difficult to learn what was in the freezer, so tightly it was packed. Additionally, it was more difficult to learn what <em>wasn't</em> in the freezer.</p>
  <p>The idea of keeping an inventory of the freezer had obvious merit. With even a simple list, we could not only know what we had on hand when looking for something to eat, but also to know what we didn't have when we've gone shopping.</p>
  <p>The seed of Icecrate was an off-hand comment about using our cellphones, to a one equipped with barcode scanners, to help maintain that list. We could simply scan an item in to the freezer while packing, and out when we retrieve it.</p>
  <p>This is the result.</p>
